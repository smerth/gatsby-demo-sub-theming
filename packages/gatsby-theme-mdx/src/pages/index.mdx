# Welcome!

This site is a demonstration of some of the features of the Gatsby Theme system.

This test page is located in the child theme `gatsby-theme-mdx` @ `source/pages`.

Normally the homepage of a Gatsby site should be at `site/source/pages/index.js` but this page over-rides the site homepage since it has the same name and is located at the shadow path inside the theme...
