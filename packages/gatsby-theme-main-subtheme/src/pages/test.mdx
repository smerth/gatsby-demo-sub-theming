# Test Page

This test page is located in the child theme `gatsby-theme-main-subtheme` @ `source/pages`.
Anything placed in `source/pages` in the child theme will overwrite the same named file in the parent theme at the same path.

<Box title="Truely Amazing Test Page">Yeah the test page is live!!!</Box>

And the same named file placed at same path in the GatsbySJ site `gatsby-site/gatsby-theme-main-subtheme/src/pages` will overwrite this file...

A whole lota overwritin' going on!
