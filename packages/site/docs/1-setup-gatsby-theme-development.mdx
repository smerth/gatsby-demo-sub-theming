# 1) Setup for theme development

We are going to create two folders. One will hold the gatsby site and one will hold the theme we are going to build. We know that eventually the theme will end up being a package on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which anyone can install in their GatsbyJS site. Whatever functionality the theme defines will then be available in their site.

However, we are in catch-22 situation. We want to install the theme as we would an NPM module but we haven't written it yet and haven't posted it to NPM so how do we pull it into the site while we are building it?

The answer is "yarn workspaces".

## Setup yarn workspace

First make a directory to hold everything.

@ desktop

```bash
mkdir theme-project
```

Cd into it.

```bash
cd theme-project
```

Intiate the workspace.

```bash
npm init
```

Run through whatever your standard responses to `init` are:

```bash
package name: (theme-project)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
license: (MIT)
```

Edit `package.json`. Delete everything but name and version, add a private key and a workspaces key.

```json
{
  "private": "true",
  "name": "theme-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": ["gatsby-site", "packages/*"]
}
```

We have defined two different workspaces so lets create both of them.

```bash
mkdir gatsby-site && mkdir packages
```

Workspaces are named locations that yarn is aware of.

## Setup our theme folder

We need somewhere to put our future node modules as we develop them. Since they will end up being node packages lets put them in a folder called packages.

```bash
cd packages
```

Make a folder for the theme we will develop.

```bash
mkdir gatsby-theme-main
```

We'll call it `gatsby-theme-main` because it will add basic `mdx` processing of markdown files to a GatsbyJS site.

```bash
cd gatsby-theme-main
```

Our theme is a NPM module so we need to init

```bash
npm init
```

Respond as usual to the prompts

```json
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-main",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A GatsbyJS theme to implement MDX processing of markdown files.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stephen Merth <stephen.merth@gmail.com> (https://smerth.github.io/)",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Note that we are declaring the main entry point to be `index.js`. There are two reasons for this. First, NPM/Node recognizes a module by its entry point. The default is `index.js`.

GatsbyJS instead looks for `gatsby-config.js` in a plugin module or a theme module and so doesn't require an `index.js` .

So, to satisfy NPM/Node many GatsbyJS plugins contain an `index.js` file with the comment `// no-ops` to indicate that the file serves no useful purpose to GatsbyJS.

The second reason to have `index.js` is to allow us to export something from the theme at some point in the future. We will cover that later.

```bash
touch index.js
```

@ index.js

```javascript
// no-op
```

## Setup our site folder

Now lets set up the GatsbyJS site folder

```bash
cd ../../gatsby-site/
```

This folder will contain our GatsbyJS site so we need to init to begin.

```bash
npm init
```

> Important:
>
> Name of the site should match the name in the workspace we set up earlier: "gatsby-site".

Since this is a GatsbyJS site set entry point as: `"main": "gatsby-config.js",`

```json
{
  "private": "true",
  "name": "gatsby-site",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A GatsbyJS site using a gatsby theme.",
  "main": "gatsby-config.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stephen Merth <stephen.merth@gmail.com> (https://smerth.github.io/)",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

So, now we have this tree:

```bash
├── package.json
├── gatsby-site
│   └── package.json
└── packages
    └── gatsby-theme-main
        ├── index.js
        └── package.json
```

Lets install GatsbyJS

```bash
cd gatsby-site/
```

Here is where we begin to use workspaces. We have three different places containing a `package.json` file. Yarn will be aware of each of these:

- Our `theme-project` folder. This is where we define our workspaces.
- Our `gatsby-site` folder.
- Our `gatsby-theme-main` folder where we will build a theme.

It would be painful to have to `cd` into these folders or specify their path everytime we wanted to execute a `yarn` command relative to each of those folders. But since we defined the workspaces we can execute `yarn` commands in any workspace using a simple referencing the workspace. Like this:

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-site add gatsby
```

Now lets add the theme to the Gatsby site. We can add it as a dependancy:

@ `gatsby-site/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "gatsby-site",
...
  "dependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.1.31",
    "gatsby-theme-main": "*"
  }
}
```

We add this as a dependancy to the `package.json ` file because the module is stored locally in our "packages" folder. If we try `yarn add gatsby-theme-main` yarn will try first to find the module on npm. If your package in develpment has the same name as a package on npm the wrong one will be loaded into your project…

Obviously, our theme is not on npm but it is in the `packages` folder and it does have a valid entry point so yarn will find it when we add it as a dependancy.

We will want to work with our Gatsby site so lets add the standard Gatsby commands.

@ `gatsby-site/package.json`

```json
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

## Add some dependancies

Lets add GatsbyJS as a dev dependancy to the theme.

@ theme-project

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-main add gatsby -D
```

Now lets edit the theme package.json to add gatsby as a peer dependancy also, just copy the `devDependancy` block and rename it peer

@ gatsby-theme-main/package.json

```json
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-main",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A GatsbyJS theme to implement MDX processing of markdown files.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stephen Merth <stephen.merth@gmail.com> (https://smerth.github.io/)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.1.31"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.1.31"
  }
}
```

Also our theme will need `react` and `react-dom`

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-main add react react-dom -D
```

And they should also be declared as `dev` and `peer` dependancies

@ gatsby-theme-main/package.json

```json
{
  "name": "gatsby-theme-main",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A GatsbyJS theme to implement MDX processing of markdown files.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stephen Merth <stephen.merth@gmail.com> (https://smerth.github.io/)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.1.31",
    "react": "^16.8.4",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.4"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.1.31",
    "react": "^16.8.4",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.4"
  }
}
```

Lets add the dependancies we need to the gatsby site as well.

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-site add react react-dom
```

## Develop the theme

Our first goal is have a theme that will add MDX processing of markdown files to a GatsbyJS site. So in the theme lets add an `.mdx` file that needs processing.

In the theme create `src/pages/index.mdx`

@ src/pages/index.mdx

```markdown
# Hello World
```

Now lets add MDX modules to the theme

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-main add gatsby-mdx
```

And we also need to add these dependancies

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-main add @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/tag
```

This is because `gatsby-mdx` is designed to allow for swapping out various processing modules for greater flexibility. We are going to process `.mdx` files, for which `gatsby-mdx` will use `@mdx-js/mdx` and we are going to replace HTML tags in markdown (like `h1`) with react components we get to define, and for that `gatsby-mdx` will use `@mdx-js/tag`.

Next we need to make Gatsby aware of the module we just added.

Add `gatsby-config.js` to the theme

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-mdx",
      options: {},
    },
  ],
};
```

Now, by default a Gatsby site looks in `src/pages` to find and process `.md` or `.mdx` files.

We need to tell Gatsby to look in another location for files to process (specfically, it should look in our theme.) That is what `gatsby-plugin-page-creator` is designed to do.

Lets install that in our theme.

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-main add gatsby-plugin-page-creator
```

After we install any Gatsby plugin we need to make Gatsby aware of it,... so lets do that

@ `gatsby-theme-main/gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-mdx",
      options: {},
    },
    // You can have multiple instances of this plugin
    // to create pages from React components in different directories.
    //
    // The following sets up the pattern of having multiple
    // "pages" directories in your project
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-page-creator`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

This path://

```javascript
path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`;
```

is relative to the theme folder so MDX in Gatbsy will now be looking for files in the theme pages folder.

Lastly, if you recall we added the theme to the Gatsby site as a dependancy. The theme is a plugin, and like any plugin we need to tell Gatsby of its existance so create a `gatsby-config.js` file in the gatsby-site folder:

@ `gatsby-site`

```bash
touch gatsby-config.js
```

and add the theme...

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["gatsby-theme-main"],
};
```

This is the special syntax for declaring theme plugins.

Its time to run the gatsby-site and see if everything is working!

First lets run yarn in the root of the project to make sure everything is linked

@ theme-project

```bash
yarn
```

We check the workspace sestup with

```bash
yarn workspaces info
```

@ theme-project

```bash
yarn workspace gatsby-site develop
```

Success!

You should now be able to go to `localhost:8000` and see the page generated from the `.mdx` file in the theme folder.

## What have we done?

- we have a working environment to develop a Gatsby theme
- we have a model for how a theme can add functionality (such as processing MDX files,) to a gatsby site
- we have a model for a how a theme can add content (a folder of MDX files in the theme,) thanks to `gatsby-plugin-page-creator`

Thats really fantastic, because you can now compartmentalize the development of complex apps. You can write a different module for commerce, podcasting, documentation, etc and pull these into a blank gatsby site, instantally adding that functionality.
