# Build a gatsby theme

This repo demonstrates some of the ways you can configure your setup to develop a Gatsby theme and some of the cool things you can do with Gatsby themes.

## What is it?

The repo consists of three `yarn` workspaces:

1) `yarn workspace gatsby-site` 

A gatsby site using the theme and a child of that theme

2) `yarn workspace gatsby-theme-mdx`

A theme for gatsby that demonstrates several things. 

- Process `.mdx` files. 
- Shadow folders, files and components in the theme with items at their equivalent path in the parent gatsby-site. 
- Export components and design tokens from the theme.

3) `yarn workspace gatsby-theme-mdx-child`

A child theme that programatically generates pages from a `docs` folder of `.mdx` files in the parent gatsby-site. The child theme provides all the setup for this
